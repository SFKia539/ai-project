        We wanted to be able to bring an you an Ai that can translate text to
        speech and speech to text, especially since. We are currently working
        towards accomplishing our goal which is to be able to use text to speech
        while using OpenAI the only difficult thing i have came across is to
        convert that back speech to text.
